zsh (5.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From the upstream README of 5.4.1:

  > The default behaviour of code like the following has changed:
  >
  >   alias foo='noglob foo'
  >   foo() { print function body; }
  >
  > When this is encountered in a start-up file, or other place where
  > input was read line by line, "foo" is in command position and is
  > expanded as an alias before the function definition takes place.  In
  > previous versions of the shell, this caused two functions "noglob" and
  > "foo" to be defined.  Any expansion of an alias in a function
  > definition is nearly always an unintended effect, as well as hard to
  > detect, so has been made an error.  (The option setting
  > NO_MULTI_FUNC_DEF turned this case into an error, but did not help
  > with other cases and is off by default.)  The alternative, of not
  > expanding the alias, was rejected as it was more difficult to achieve
  > in the parser and also would silently change the shell's behaviur
  > between versions.  A new option, ALIAS_FUNC_DEF, has been added, which
  > can be set to make the shell behave as in previous versions.  It is in
  > any case recommended to use the "function" keyword, as aliases are not
  > expanded afterwards.

  The common error message triggered by this change looks as follows:

  > zsh: defining function based on alias `foo'
  > zsh: parse error near `()'

zsh (5.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This update includes a rewrite of keyboard handling in `/etc/zsh/zshrc'.

  The used method should be quite a bit more robust than the old one, and
  should work out of the box for every terminal with a working terminfo entry.

  If you do not want Debian's zshrc to mess with your keyboard setup, set the
  following variable in your `.zshenv' file:

    DEBIAN_PREVENT_KEYBOARD_CHANGES=yes

  This change also removes the controversial vi-* bindings for the up and down
  cursor keys (which was reported as #383737 and led to confusion with a
  substantial number of users). If you want them back use the following snippet
  in your `.zshrc' file (and without the above variable set):

    for i in viins vicmd; do
      bindkey -M "$i" "${key[Up]}" vi-up-line-or-history
      bindkey -M "$i" "${key[Down]}" vi-down-line-or-history
    done
    unset i
